## My advent of code 2024

My advent of code 2024 was a bit of a disappointment.

I had high hopes for my 2024 Advent of Code. It started off well, and the first few days I was flying through the questions, and I had time to do them. Then life came along and took some time away from me, so I got a few days behind, and after that it was over. I don't want to make too many excuses, but we just had a kid who was 4 months old in December, and that took most of my time away, and I had a few stressful projects at work that didn't give me extra time to work on the Advent of Code.

Enough excuses... I got to day 8, which is an improvement since last year, but still not good at all. Better luck next year, I guess.

#### Reflections
I used Zed as my IDE for these little puzzles, and that worked very well. I didn't enable any plugins for a pretty raw experience, and I quite liked it. It's not that different, per se; it was just fun and felt fresh with a different UI. It's pretty minimal, which I like, but I won't switch from Cursor, which I am using now.

Deno also felt very good, even though I barely scratched the surface of what you can do with Deno; it was very easy to set up and get going, which was nice, and I never had any issues with it. Might try Deno out some more in future projects.
